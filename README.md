📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to model the rainfall–runoff relationship based on synthetic hydrological data. It demonstrates how ML can be applied for hydrological forecasting and water resource management without relying on real-world proprietary datasets.

🎯 Objectives
Generate synthetic rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, API, and runoff data.

Train multiple ML models to predict runoff from meteorological and hydrological inputs.

Compare model performances using standard regression metrics.

Visualize observed vs predicted runoff.

Random Forest & Gradient Boosting for non-linear regression

Linear Regression as a baseline model

📊 Methodology
Synthetic Data Generation – Create >100 points of realistic rainfall-runoff data using hydrological assumptions.

Feature Selection – Use rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and API as predictors.

Model Training – Fit Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.

Evaluation – Assess RMSE, MAE, and R² for each model.

Visualization – Plot observed vs predicted runoff for the best-performing model.

📈 Example Output
CSV/Excel dataset of rainfall-runoff data.
